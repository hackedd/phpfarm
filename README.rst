phpfarm
=======

phpfarm is a set of scripts to install a dozen of PHP versions in parallel
on a single system. It also installs the pear and pyrus installers and
creates a local Pyrus installation for each PHP version as well.

This tool was primarily developed for PEAR's continuous integration machine.

The PHP source packages are fetched from http://museum.php.net/ (which is not
always up-to-date), the official php.net download pages and the pre-release
channels.

The Pyrus PHAR archive is fetched from http://pear2.php.net/pyrus.phar (which
always refers the latest version).

Last but not least, phpfarm can automatically apply the Suhosin patch
for the version of PHP you are installing. It does so by looking at
http://www.hardened-php.net/suhosin/download.html for compatible versions
of the patch.

If a file cannot be found, try to fetch it manually and put it into
``src/bzips/``.


Setup
-----
- Check out phpfarm from git:
  ``git clone git://git.code.sf.net/p/phpfarm/code phpfarm``
- ``cd phpfarm/src/``
- ``./main.sh 5.3.0``
- PHP gets installed into ``phpfarm/inst/php-$version/``
- ``phpfarm/inst/bin/php-$version`` is also executable
  You should add ``inst/bin`` and ``inst/main`` to your ``$PATH``,
  i.e. ``PATH="$PATH:$HOME/phpfarm/inst/bin:$HOME/phpfarm/inst/main"``
  in ``.bashrc``


Configure options customization
-------------------------------
Default configuration options are in ``src/options.sh``.
You may create version-specific custom option files:

- ``custom/options.sh``
- ``custom/options-5.sh``
- ``custom/options-5.3.sh``
- ``custom/options-5.3.1.sh``

The shell script needs to define a variable "``$configoptions``" with
all ``./configure`` options.
Do not try to change ``prefix`` and ``exec-prefix``.


Patching
--------
phpfarm will automatically apply patches found in the ``custom/`` directory:

- ``custom/php5-something.patch``
- ``custom/php5.3-something.patch``
- ``custom/php5.3.1-something.patch``

Patches will be applied using ``patch -p1`` with the PHP source directory as
working directory. Patches will be aplied directly after extracting the
source from the archive (before applying the Suhosin patch).

php.ini customization
---------------------
``php.ini`` values may also be customized:

- ``custom/php.ini``
- ``custom/php-5.ini``
- ``custom/php-5.3.ini``
- ``custom/php-5.3.1.ini``

Please note that a few substitutions are done in those files in order
to generate the final php.ini configuration file. Namely, the following
variables are substitued:

- ``$ext_dir`` gets replaced by the path to the extension directory
  This is mostly used to set the ``extension_dir`` option to the right
  value.
  This is also useful when installing a ``zend_extension`` like
  Xdebug as ``extension_dir`` is not automatically prepended to the
  path for those extensions.


.. _`post-install script`:

Post-install customization
--------------------------
You may also create version-specific scripts that will be run after
the PHP binary has been successfully compiled, installed and configured:

- ``custom/post-install.sh``
- ``custom/post-install-5.sh``
- ``custom/post-install-5.3.sh``
- ``custom/post-install-5.3.1.sh``

These scripts can be used for example to discover PEAR channels
and pre-install some extensions/packages needed by your project.

Each script is called with three arguments:

- The PHP version that was just installed (eg. ``5.3.1-zts-suhosin-debug``).
- The full path to the folder where that version was install
  (eg. ``/home/clicky/phpfarm/inst/php-5.3.1-zts-suhosin-debug/``).
- The full path to the shared folder containing the links to the main
  executables for each version (eg. ``/home/clicky/phpfarm/inst/bin/``).

.. note::
    You do not need to specify a "shebang line" (``#!...``) at the beginning
    of the scripts. Bash will always be used to execute them.

Given all the previous bits of information, the following shell script may
be used to discover a PEAR channel and install a PEAR extension::

    # "$3/pear-$1" could also be used in place of "$2/bin/pear" to refer
    # to the pear installer for this specific version of PHP.
    "$2/bin/pear" channel-discover pear.phpunit.de
    "$2/bin/pear" install pear.phpunit.de/PHPUnit

    # The exit status must be 0 when the scripts terminates without any error.
    # Any other value will be treated as an error.
    exit 0

.. warning::
    Your post-install customization script should always exit with a zero
    status when they terminate normally. Any other value will be considered
    a failure and will make phpfarm exit immediately with an error.


Special flags in version strings
--------------------------------

phpfarm recognizes a few special flags in the version string.
These flags must be appended to the version string and separated
from it and from one another by dashes (-).

The following flags are currently accepted:

- ``debug`` to compile a version with debugging symbols.
- ``zts`` to enable thread safety.
- ``32bits`` to force the creation of a 32 bits version of PHP on a 64 bits
  machine.
- ``gcov`` to enable GCOV code coverage information (requires LTP).
- ``suhosin`` to apply the Suhosin patch before compiling PHP.
  This patch provides several enhancements to build an hardened PHP binary.

.. warning::
    The ``suhosin`` flag only applies the Suhosin patch. It does not
    automatically install the Suhosin extension. If you want to benefit
    from the whole set of attack mitigation techniques provided by Suhosin,
    you must also install the Suhosin extension separately (and manually),
    using a `post-install script`_

For example, to build a thread-safe version of PHP 5.3.1 with debugging
symboles, use::

    ./main.sh  5.3.1-zts-debug

.. note::
    The order in which the flags appear does not matter, phpfarm will
    reorganize them if needed. Hence, ``5.3.1-zts-debug`` is effectively
    the same as ``5.3.1-debug-zts``.

Bonus features
--------------
You may actually compile and install several versions of PHP in turn
by passing the name of each version to ``main.sh``::

    ./main.sh  5.3.1  5.4.0beta1

You may also create a file called ``custom/default-versions.txt``
which contains the names of the versions (one per line) you want
installed by default.
Empty lines are ignored in this file. Lines starting with a hash (#)
are treated as comments and also ignored.
This file will be used by ``./main.sh`` when it's called without any
argument and is mostly useful when you often need to recompile the same
versions of PHP (eg. as part of a Continuous Integration process).
It generally looks somewhat like this::

    # Generic version used for dev.
    5.3.1

    # Beta version used to test for regressions
    # and to report bugs to the PHP folks.
    5.4.0beta1

    # Custom version which installs specific extensions/packages
    # required for production during the post-install step.
    5.3.1-prod

Last but now least, when using a ``custom/default-versions.txt`` file,
the first version in this file will be marked as your "main version".
So, if phpfarm's ``inst/main`` directory is in your ``$PATH`` and there
is no ``php`` executable installed globally on your system, calling
``php`` will actually execute your main version's ``php``.


Caveats
-------
The following entries are known issues which may or may not be solved
in the future:

- Do not use ``--enable-sigchld`` in your custom options if you plan
  to install extensions using pear/pecl. When enabled, this option
  will result in a failure during the ``phpize`` step (this issue
  lies in PHP itself and is not specific to phpfarm).

- By default, a (local) PEAR installation is created for every PHP version
  you build. If you don't plan to use PEAR, you can prevent this from
  happening by adding ``--without-pear`` to your ``$configoptions``.
